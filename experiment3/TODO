X make run_harmonizer run
X make it return fake targets in the same format
X remove accum, dep, cap to keep it simple
X calc target fulfillment and finaloutput
X make it work with UK data
X implement fake balance
  X random initial weights
  X output target
X can we use an alg from ML instead?
- what other data do we need for a MVP -> I think nothing
  - limited resources for each year (e.g. labor, coal)
  - initial resources
- without additional limits, wouldn't the below alg just produce huge amounts without limit?
- optimization loop:
  X with current product weights calc harmony for each product
  - sort by harmony
  - reduce production of over and increase production of under fulfilled
    - don't we have to check which input product is critical and optimize for that?
  - calc output
  - watch progress
- do I need the complicated derivative calculation from paul?
